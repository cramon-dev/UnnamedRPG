Player

-Should I have an experience based system? My thought was that players would gain new abilities and become more effective in combat based on the skills they use. A player that mainly uses melee weapons and attacks with strength rather than finesse would gain stats in strength, for example.

-What should a player have?
	-Stats
	-Status effects
	-Inventory
	-Equipment
	-Weight load
	-Tool belt (a player would have items on their tool belt; attempting to use items that aren't on their tool belt will force them to use that turn to search for the item in their inventory)
	-Fatigue
	-Morale
	-Skills

Morale:

-As morale lowers, combat effectiveness decreases
-Certain characters will never have morale completely depleted or decreased past a certain threshold
-Scale:
	-100%: Full effectiveness
	-50%: All damage taken increased by 10%, 50% more likely to be under status effects, deal 10% less damage to enemies. 10% chance to whiff attacks, 33% chance to ??? (can't remember what I was thinking here)
	-0%: All damage taken increased by 25%, unable to resist any status effects, deal 25% less damage to enemies
	
LOSING ALL MORALE PUTS YOU AT RISK OF DEATH
You wouldn't normally die, just get knocked out of a fight and forced to retreat. Having progressively lower morale leads to higher chance of death.
